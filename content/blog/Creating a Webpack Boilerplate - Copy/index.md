##  When to create a boileplate
As years goes by the projects I get to work on are getting more & more demanding. Also all of this projects might not be identical but for sure they have something in common. After some research I decided to organize a starter where I could bundle all of the important parts I need for each starting.

There are many different ways on how to start a new project. For example if you're working on a WordPress website depending on your skillset and workflow you can use from a bare custom theme that follows all the specification that WP requires or use  something pre-made like bedrock or understrap. In my case I decided to build a simple  webpack boilerplate where can be extended or intergrated inside a cms like WordPress or Prismic etc....

### NO USE of Frameworks
Someone could possibly say that this is a dumb approach and you're trying to reinvent the wheel. Well, I could agree but there is an aspect we need to consider. 

All frameworks have something in common and it's called understanding of how JS works under the hood.  The last years we've got multiple new frameworks and that's really awesome but there is a dark side on this era.

**Frameworks are evolving and developers need to adopt, refactor and play with new rules.**  That I think is the only reason to create a simple boilerplate. Use Only vanilla JS with some basic packages so that we'reget our selfes free from the update hell and most important anyone could jump on the project and understand the code on a glimpse.
